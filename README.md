# HousePricePrediction


**Stacked Regressions: **

This repository demonstrates how to use stacked regression models to predict house prices. The solution presented in this repository involves advanced techniques in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model stacking to achieve high accuracy.


**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive walkthrough of how to tackle a regression problem using stacked models. It focuses on predicting house prices using data from the Ames Housing dataset, leveraging multiple regression models and combining them through a stacking approach to improve predictive performance.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this repository is the Ames Housing dataset, which contains 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The target variable is "SalePrice", which represents the price at which each property was sold.

- **Train data:** Includes both features and the target variable ("SalePrice").
- **Test data:** Includes only features; the target variable is to be predicted.

**Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering plays a critical role in this project. Key steps include:

- **Handling Missing Data:** Missing values are imputed or filled with appropriate values based on domain knowledge.
- **Label Encoding and Transformation:** Categorical features are label-encoded, and some are transformed using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling:** Continuous variables are scaled, and skewed variables are transformed to reduce skewness and improve model performance.
- **Creating New Features:** New features are derived by combining existing ones to capture more complex relationships in the data.

**Modeling**

Several regression models are trained, including:

- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Both XGBoost and LightGBM

Each model is tuned using cross-validation to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

**Stacking Regressions**

The core technique in this notebook is model stacking:

- **Base Models:** Multiple base models are trained independently.
- **Meta-Model:** A meta-model is trained using the predictions from the base models as inputs.
- **Final Predictions:** The meta-model combines the base modelsâ€™ predictions to make the final predictions on the test data.

This approach leverages the strengths of different models, resulting in improved performance.

**Evaluation**

The performance of the models is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the log-transformed target variable. Cross-validation is extensively used to validate the models and avoid overfitting.

**Results**

The final stacked regression model produced a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.1087 on the log-transformed sale prices, which corresponds to an impressive performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the ensemble learning approach combined with rigorous feature engineering and model tuning.


**Conclusion**

This notebook illustrates the power of ensemble learning, particularly stacking, in improving the accuracy of regression models. The techniques used here can be applied to various other regression problems where predictive performance is crucial.
